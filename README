This is a project, using the PureData sound engine in a game. The targeted game is Xinvaders (credited and distributed freely by Jonny Goldman).

The PureData environment receives OSC commands by socket from the invaders game in realtime, for this demo I'm trying out Libl0 (liblo.sourceforge.net/) which is an OSC implementation in ANSI-C.

This is just a proof of concept, so in terms of sound I only generate a sine wave when a "invader" is destroyed by the player.

Inside Pure Data i use dumpOSC (it is deprecated but works for this proof) from Berkley OSC project (cnmat.cnmat.berkeley.edu/OSC).

This is a follow up of the Andy Farnell great tutorial for Pd with game development (obiwannabe.co.uk/tutorials/gamedev/OSC/oschooks.html)!
